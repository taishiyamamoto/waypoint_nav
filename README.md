You can set some functions if you add function to source program.
This program has two functions, "run" and "suspend".  
However, "function" is not compulsory.  

- run  
  This is normal mode.  
  When your robot gets at target waypoint, makes for next waypoint.

- suspend  
  This makes your robot suspend mode after moving.

## Suspend Mode
When you want a robot to start or resume navigation, call `rosservice` like below.  
`
$ rosservice call /start_wp_nav "{}"
`

When you want a robot to set suspend mode, call `rosservice` like below.  
`
$ rosservice call /suspend_wp_nav "{}"
`
